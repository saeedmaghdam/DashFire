# DashFire
> A .Net library to create jobs and services which could connect to DashFire Dashboard easily.

DashFire is totally free and open source .Net library to create jobs and services, schedule, log and manage them easily.

When you create a Worker Service in .Net, or Windows Service in .Net Framework, you'll not only care about the logic of the business, but about logging, managing, scheduling and etc. 

But using DashFire, you only implement the logic of the business, the issues like communicating with the server (DashFire Dashboard), logging, scheduling and other sort of issues will be handled by the DashFire.
Then, you can host the jobs in Services (in Windows) or Systemd (in Linux based operation systems).

### P.S. This library is an alternative to HangFire which is a professional task scheduling library used by million of people around the world. This project is not as generic as HangFire, but I wanted to make a fully customized task scheduler. This is a very fundamental version which handles the basics of communications and scheduling, for extending the library and server, you can easily fork the project and extend it.

## Usage example

1. First step is to add a job inheriting from Job and implement the required methods and properties:
```cs 
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace DashFire.Service.Sample
{
    public class SampleJob1 : Job
    {
        public override JobInformation JobInformation => throw new System.NotImplementedException();

        protected override Task StartInternallyAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) => throw new System.NotImplementedException();
    }
}

```
Dependency injection works as well.


2. Second step is to configure the worker:
In Program.cs, Add jobs to services, and use UseDashFire method in your host builder:
```cs
        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
                {
                    services.AddJob<SampleJob1>();
                })
                .UseDashFire();
```

3. Add required settings to appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "DashOptions": {
    "RabbitMqConnectionString": "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"
  },
  "SampleJob1": {
    "InstanceId": "R4uXWDOBp0m-FzI4GVF3sQ"
  }
}
```

Sample appsettings.json is available at:

https://github.com/saeedmaghdam/DashFire/blob/master/samples/SampleJob/appsettings.json

That's it!
Now you can run the app and it's do the rest!
